## Description:

An online casino where users will have to create an account to login in order to play Roulette and win chips. 

<br>

## User Story:

I like gambling but I dont like losing my hard earned money. So, I want a program that can recreate the experience of gambling without actually risking my funds. I want a game where I get virtual money from winning and lose money when I lose. Therefore, I get the experience of possibly losing or winning money just like how a real gambling is without actually losing real money. If I run out of virtual money I have to watch a short video to acquire more virtual money. If i win enough money I will unlock different achivement status that will allow me to access other functionalities (higher limit tables, VIP Rooms, other games, etc.).

<br>

## Acceptance Criteria:

-Users must create a original username and password <br>
-This creates an account that is linked to their IP address and verified email address(confirmation code sent via email) <br>
-Users must authenticate themselves via verification code that will be sent to their email<br>
-Users starts the game with 1,000 chips(1 chip = 1 dollar - "NOT REAL MONEY")<br>
-Users can bet a minimum 5 chips and a maximum of 100 chips in the initial rookie table<br>
-If the user runs out of coins they will have to watch a short video to gain more coins<br>
-If user wins 250 chips they will unlock the next level where user minimum is 50 and maximum is 250<br>
-User can win from rookie table (min 50-max 250), beginner table (min 100 - max 500), veteran table (min 200 - max 1000), VIP table (min 500 - max 2500), and finally highroller table (min 1000 - max 10000)<br>
