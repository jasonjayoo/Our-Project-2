## Description:

An online casino where users will have to create an account to login in order to play Dice!. Users will be allowed to either login or create a username and password to enter the casino. After entering users will be able to decide between betting increments of 5, 10, 100, and 500 coins. If Users reach 1000 coins they will be able to enter the "VIP room". In the "VIP room" users can only make 1000 coin bets. If user runs out of funds they will have to watch a short video to gain 50 coins. If user registers email they can gain 1000 coins. User will be able to log out and coin fund will be saved. 

<br>

## User Story:

I like gambling but I dont like losing my hard earned money. So, I want a program that can recreate the experience of gambling without actually risking my funds. I want a game where I get virtual money from winning and lose money when I lose. Therefore, I get the experience of possibly losing or winning money just like how a real gambling experience is without actually losing real money. If I run out of virtual money I have the option to watch a short video in order to acquire more virtual funds. If i win enough money I will unlock accessibility to higher betting tiers that will allow me to access higher limit rooms.

<br>

## Acceptance Criteria:

-Users must create a original username and password <br>
-This creates an account that is linked to their IP address and verified email address(confirmation code sent via email) <br>
-Users must authenticate themselves via verification code that will be sent to their email<br>
-Users starts the game with 500 chips(1 chip = 1 dollar - "NOT REAL MONEY")<br>
-Users can bet a minimum 5 chips and a maximum of 500 chips in the initial rookie table<br>
-If the user runs out of coins they will have to watch a short video to gain more coins<br>
-User can win from starting table (5, 10, 100, 500 bet), VIP table (1000 bet).<br>
-If the user is finished playing they can save their current chips count and log out<br>
